# Microstocks
Microstocks is an arcade resource gathering game written in Javascript. The object of the game is to try and make the most money by selling high and buying low! This came about while I was reading "[Javascript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)" by Douglas Crockford (great stuff, I recommend it). Initially, it was going to just be a way to generate stock names, but I haven't stopped exploring javascript. 
This is the result.
